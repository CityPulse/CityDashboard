# City Dashboard


The CityPulse framework provides immediate and intuitive visual access to the results of its intelligent processing and manipulation of data and events. The ability to record and store historical (cleaned and summarized) data for post-processing makes it possible to analyse the status of the city not only on the go but also at any point in time, enabling diagnosing and “post mortem” analysis of any incidents or relevant situation that might have occurred. To facilitate that, a dashboard for visualising the dynamic data of the smart cities is provided on  top of the CityPulse framework. Based on this dashboard, the user has the possibility to visualise a holistic and summarised view of data across multiple contexts or a detailed view of data of interest, as well as to monitor the city life as it evolves and as things happens. The investigation of past city events or incidents can be conducted from different perspectives, e.g. by observing the correlations between various streams, since the streaming data is stored in the framework for a period of time which can be configured, and it can be retrieved for visualisation and analysis at any moment. The figure below depicts a snapshot of the CityPulse dashboard application.

In order to display the status of the city, the dashboard application connects directly to the resource management or to the data bus for fetching the description of the available streams or the real-time/historic observations. The dashboard application can be used out of the box and there are no configuration or development steps that have to be done by the application developer.
